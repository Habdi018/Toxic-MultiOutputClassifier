# Toxic-MultiOutputClassifier

This repository includes the scripts to train classifiers for Toxic Comment Classification Challenge. In this regard, I build a multi-label model which is capable of identifying and classifying toxicity such as toxic, severe toxic, threats, obscenity, insults, and identity hate. The official URL for the dataset is as follows:
